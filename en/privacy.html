                        <p>We do not use cookies on the website www.vod-prime.space and therefore do not collect any information from our visitors. Our Cloud Provider may, at their discretion, collect some technical data in accordance with French law.

                          <p>When you install the Prime-Space browser extension for the User Agent, a pseudo-random identifier is generated and stored in your browser memory and transmitted to our servers whenever you contribute any data to our study. This identifier serves multiple purposes:
                            <ul>
                              <li>It distinguishes your computer from all the other computers where the Prime-Space extension is installed.</li>
                              <li>It acts as a placeholder for any personal information, thereby allowing us to gather your usage data in an anonymous manner. This means that instead of your name or email address, we only have access to your randomly-generated identifier. This way, we can collect non-personal data in a way that does not allow for direct association with any specific individual.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          <p>The Prime-Space extension collects and stores information that is generated as you browse the Content Provider on your User Agent. The data that we collect is limited to:
                            <ul>
                              <li>your screen size,</li>
                              <li>the unique Content Provider identifier for every content that appears on your screen,</li>
                              <li>the location (row number and rank number) of every Content Provider identifier on your screen,</li>
                              <li>the unique Content Provider identifier of each row shown on the page (“US Dark TV Comedies” for example),</li>
                              <li>the unique Content Provider identifier for every content that you decide to watch.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                        <p>We do not store your IP address, as it is anonymized in our logs.</p>
                        <p>We do not use cookies.</p>
                        <p>We do not have access to your Content Provider credentials (username and password).</p>
                        <p>Your unique identifier is associated only to your User Agent, meaning that we collect data irrespective of the account or profile you use on the Content Provider’s service.</p>
                        <p>We take steps to ensure that you retain full ownership of your data.<br>
                        By clicking on “Access Your Data” in the extension menu, you can view all of the data that we have collected from your Content Provider activity since you have installed the extension. We also provide you with the ability to opt out of providing us with the suggestions that the Content Provider will display on your account in the future. The same applies to the content that you click on, for which we collect the unique Content Provider identifier.
                        <br>Whatsmore, you can notify us at any time of your wish to delete all data associated with your Content Provider activity ever since you have installed the extension. All data associated with your unique identifier will be deleted from our servers within a 48h delay.
                        <br>You can also send us an email at contact@vod-prime.space and we will do our best to help you with any concerns that you might have.
                        </p>
                        <p>The data that we collect is for research purposes only. We will not make any attempt to sell your data or transfer it to a third party. We may use aggregate data in academic publications or communications.</p>
