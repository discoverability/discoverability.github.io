    <title>Prime-space: A Browser extension made with ♥ at Sorbonne</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>The Prime-Space Chrome extension is part of an experiment by researchers at the Sorbonne aiming to identify the mechanisms that promote or endanger the visibility of content on Netflix. The overall goal is to assess the extent to which prominence carries economic weight in the audiovisual sector. In the same way that “prime-time” hours on linear television are known, branded as such, and in some countries even regulated, on-demand services also have to contend with the issue of prominence, only not so much in time as in space. We can then consider that the on-demand equivalent to “prime-time” television is “prime-space” for the likes of Netflix.

	By installing this plugin on your Chrome browser, you will help us understand how a user’s behaviour impacts the types of contents that are promoted on his/her Netflix homepage. </p>
